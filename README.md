# ClaireBOT
This is a simple bot I made while watching a tutorial by FreeCodeCamp to get started. While it is very simple it will be updated throughout its lifespan and gain updates for making servers more interactable as well as potentially adding support for specific game interactions.
# Current Features
1. $inspire - Grabs a inspirational quote and posts in chat including author. <br>
2. keyword support - when certain keywords (ie. ffxiv, ff, final fantasy, chocobo) is mentioned in chat it will respond with a copypasta. <br>
# Editor
I used Replit.com to code and create this bot.
# host
The bot is kept online and monitored by .UptimeRobot <br>
<br>
Replit.com requires paid subscription to get more than 20 checks a day to keep the bot online (it will power down within an hour of inactivity) so .UptimeRobot pings every 5 minutes to keep it online.
